# Database-Query-Automation-Tool

It also act as Database Infrastructure as code.

QUAT is a Query Automation software tool to create database infrastructure. Here users need to define the query of 
databases in key-value configuration language similar to json or yml. In real world, data is not stored in one single 
database as one database is not  sufficient to solve the data problems for that we have tons of different database with 
different use case. But the problem is each database has their own query language  to operate and it is difficult for 
one to learn every language, sometime query gets long and confusing. This one tool smart enough to interact multiple 
databases at one time and can setup the entire database with one click. Since the formate is in key-pair, no 
confusion and easy to write all database query in single go with version controlling system
